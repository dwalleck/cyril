This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

*Cyril is the polished TUI for the Agent Client Protocol ecosystem.*

Cyril is a polished terminal interface for the Agent Client Protocol ecosystem. Run any of 37+ registered agents — Claude, Cursor, Codex, Cline, Goose, Kiro, and more — through a single interface. Beneath the TUI, composable proxy stages add behaviors no agent ships natively: skill systems, transcript audit, organizational permission policies, persistent memory across sessions, multi-client observers. Vendor neutrality is a feature, not a roadmap; stages are how cyril compounds value over time.

**Status:** Alpha. Today cyril works against Kiro CLI; vendor-neutral agent selection and the proxy-stage layer are in active development. The descriptive sections below document the current Kiro-focused implementation, not the long-term vision.

**Direction:** see [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) for the phased path from current Kiro-focused implementation toward vendor-neutral platform status. New non-trivial work should land in a numbered phase from that document.

## Build & Test Commands

```sh
cargo build                                                    # build all crates
cargo check                                                    # type-check without linking (faster)
cargo check --all-targets                                      # also covers examples and tests
cargo run                                                      # run the cyril TUI binary
cargo run --example test_bridge -- --agent-command kiro-cli acp  # end-to-end ACP smoke harness
cargo test -p cyril-core                                       # run tests in the core crate
cargo test -p cyril-core -- path                               # run only path-related tests
```

The project uses Rust 2024 edition, pinned to `1.94.0` via `rust-toolchain.toml`.

```sh
cargo fmt --check                    # verify formatting
cargo clippy -- -D warnings          # lint — all warnings are errors
```

## Development Workflow

### Verify After Every Logical Change

When making multi-file Rust changes, always run `cargo test` and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` after each logical change set before moving on. Never rely on IDE diagnostics alone — rust-analyzer state can be stale, especially after cross-crate changes or renames. If `cargo check` passes but your IDE shows errors, trust `cargo check`.

### Refactoring and Rewrites

After any rewrite or large refactor, verify functional wiring end-to-end before declaring the work complete:

- Event handlers are connected — notifications reach both `SessionController` and `UiState`
- Streaming behavior works correctly (append, not replace) — test with a real `kiro-cli acp` session
- All features from the previous version still function — check the key handling chain, overlays, and command dispatch
- Cross-cutting concerns in `App` are preserved — picker wiring, model extraction, subagent routing

### Subagent and Task Guidelines

When using subagents for code changes:

- **Non-overlapping file scopes** — each subagent must work on a distinct set of files. If two agents need to touch the same file, serialize them.
- **Each agent validates its own work** — run `cargo test` and `cargo clippy` before finishing, not just after all agents complete.
- **Verify completeness before moving on** — after each subagent finishes, check for unstaged files, incomplete implementations, and TODO comments left behind.
- **Never weaken lint rules** — if a subagent disables `unsafe_code = "forbid"` or downgrades `unwrap_used = "deny"` to make its code compile, that is a bug to fix, not a shortcut to accept.

### Reverse Engineering

When reverse-engineering Kiro CLI or similar tools, follow this priority order:

1. **Application logs first** — check `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/kiro-log/kiro-chat.log` and `~/.kiro/` for structured logs and SQLite databases
2. **Bundled source extraction** — Kiro ships a bundled `tui.js` (React/Ink TUI) that contains TypeScript interfaces and protocol handling; extract and read it
3. **Binary string extraction** — `strings` / symbol analysis on unstripped binaries as a last resort
4. **Protocol tracing** — use the logging proxy at `experiments/kiro-proxy-rs/` to capture live ACP traffic

Check logs and databases before attempting binary analysis — they're more reliable and faster to work with.

### Research archive

Kiro binaries, tui.js bundles, and strings dumps live **outside the repo** at `~/.local/share/kiro-research/`:

```
~/.local/share/kiro-research/
├── binaries/<ver>/      # kiro-cli, kiro-cli-chat, kiro-cli-term + BUILD-INFO
├── tui-bundles/         # kiro-tui-<ver>.js + .sha256 sidecars
└── strings/<ver>/       # *.strings dumps for old versions
```

Why outside: binaries are 3.3 GB across versions and reproducible from the versioned S3 origin (`https://desktop-release.q.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/<ver>/kirocli-<arch>-linux.tar.zst`). `.gitignore` blocks `docs/kiro-binaries-*/` and `docs/kiro-tui-*.js*` to prevent accidental git addition.

Small derived items (manual ACP captures, extracted system prompts, changelogs, schemas) stay in `docs/kiro-*` since they're version-controlled-friendly and load-bearing for tooling like `experiments/conductor-spike/diff_fields.py`.

Tooling references the archive via `$HOME/.local/share/kiro-research/binaries/<ver>/...` — see `experiments/conductor-spike/conductor-wrapper-2.1.0.sh` for the pattern.

## Architecture

### Three-Crate Workspace

```
crates/
  cyril-core/     # Library — protocol, types, commands, session, platform
  cyril-ui/       # Library — rendering, widgets, UI state (depends on cyril-core)
  cyril/          # Binary — wires everything together, owns the event loop
```

### Layer Responsibilities

Each crate has a clear responsibility and strict rules about what it must NOT do:

**`cyril-core`** — Domain logic and protocol boundary.
- **Owns:** Types (`types/`), ACP protocol bridge (`protocol/`), command registry (`commands/`), session state (`session.rs`), path translation (`platform/`), error types (`error.rs`)
- **Responsibility:** Convert between ACP wire types and internal domain types. Generic ACP conversion lives in `convert/mod.rs`; Kiro-specific extensions live in `convert/kiro.rs`. The bridge runs on a dedicated `!Send` thread and communicates via typed channels.
- **Must NOT:** Import any UI crate. Reference ratatui, crossterm, or any rendering concept. Know how content is displayed.
- **Dependency rule:** Only crate that imports `agent-client-protocol`. No other crate may reference `acp::` types.

**`cyril-ui`** — Rendering and UI state.
- **Owns:** `UiState` (all mutable UI state), `TuiState` trait (read-only rendering interface), widgets (`widgets/`), markdown rendering, syntax highlighting, file completer, stream buffer
- **Responsibility:** Given notifications, update UI state. Given `&dyn TuiState`, render frames. All rendering decisions live here.
- **Must NOT:** Import `agent-client-protocol`. Know about ACP, JSON-RPC, or the bridge. Send commands to the bridge. Make async calls.
- **Dependency rule:** Depends on `cyril-core` for types only — never `protocol::`.

**`cyril`** — Thin orchestrator binary.
- **Owns:** `App` (event loop), CLI args, terminal setup, wiring between components
- **Responsibility:** Wire `cyril-core` and `cyril-ui` together. Run the `tokio::select!` event loop. Dispatch key events through the layered handler. Route notifications to both `SessionController` and `UiState`. Handle cross-cutting concerns (opening pickers from `CommandOptionsReceived`, extracting model from `CommandExecuted`).
- **Must NOT:** Contain business logic or protocol knowledge. Parse JSON responses (that's `cyril-core`'s job). Make rendering decisions (that's `cyril-ui`'s job).

### Component Separation Within Crates

The crate boundaries enforce dependency rules, but equally important is the separation **within** each crate. Each component has a single responsibility:

**`SessionController`** (`cyril-core/session.rs`) — Pure state machine for session data.
- `apply_notification(&Notification) -> bool` — updates session fields, returns whether state changed
- No async. No side effects. No bridge access. No UI knowledge.
- Owns: session ID, current mode, cached model, context usage, credit usage, agent commands
- Testable by constructing a controller, applying notifications, and asserting field values.

**`UiState`** (`cyril-ui/state.rs`) — Pure state machine for UI data.
- `apply_notification(&Notification) -> bool` — updates UI fields, returns whether state changed
- No async. No bridge access. Does not send commands or open pickers.
- Owns: messages, streaming buffers, tool call index, input text/cursor, autocomplete, approval/picker overlays, activity state, subagent tracker, subagent UI streams
- Subagent state is mutated via delegating methods (`apply_subagent_notification`, `apply_subagent_list_update`, `focus_subagent`, etc.) — callers never reach into the private `subagents` field.
- Testable by constructing state, applying notifications, and asserting field values.

**`CommandRegistry`** (`cyril-core/commands/mod.rs`) — Command dispatch.
- `parse(&str) -> Option<(&dyn Command, &str)>` — finds the command, returns it with args
- Commands get `CommandContext { session: &SessionController, bridge: &BridgeSender, subagent_tracker: Option<&SubagentTracker> }` — read-only session and tracker, write-only bridge. No UI state access.
- Commands return `CommandResult` (SystemMessage/ShowPicker/Dispatched/Quit) — the App decides what to do with the result.

**`App`** (`cyril/app.rs`) — Thin orchestrator. Owns all components but contains no business logic.
- Routes notifications to both `SessionController` and `UiState`
- Handles cross-cutting concerns: wiring `CommandOptionsReceived` to `show_picker()`, extracting model from `CommandExecuted`
- The ONLY place where all components interact — if logic can live in a component, it should not be in App.

**`convert/`** (`cyril-core/protocol/convert/`) — Directory module that imports both `acp::` and internal types. `mod.rs` handles generic ACP; `kiro.rs` handles Kiro-specific extensions.
- All Kiro protocol quirks live in `kiro.rs`: subagent helpers, `kiro.dev/*` method dispatch, metadata parsing.
- If a new Kiro deviation is discovered, handle it in `convert/kiro.rs` — never in `mod.rs`.
- A second vendor (e.g. `convert/claude.rs`) would follow the same pattern.

**`TuiState` trait** (`cyril-ui/traits.rs`) — Read-only rendering contract.
- ~25 methods, all returning references or Copy types
- The renderer receives `&dyn TuiState`, never `&App` or `&mut UiState`
- Compile-time guarantee that rendering cannot mutate state

**`TrackedToolCall`** (`cyril-ui/traits.rs`) — Display-oriented wrapper around `cyril_core::types::ToolCall`.
- Adds display logic: `primary_path()`, `command_text()` — these are presentation concerns, not data concerns
- The core `ToolCall` carries data; `TrackedToolCall` interprets it for display

### Data Flow

```
User input → CommandRegistry::parse() → Command::execute() → BridgeSender::send(BridgeCommand)
                                                                    ↓ (mpsc channel)
                                                              Bridge thread (dedicated OS thread)
                                                                    ↓ (JSON-RPC over stdio)
                                                              kiro-cli acp
                                                                    ↓ (ACP callbacks)
                                                              KiroClient (protocol/client.rs)
                                                                    ↓ (mpsc channels)
                                                    Notification / PermissionRequest
                                                                    ↓
App event loop (tokio::select!):
  ├─ Notification → SessionController::apply_notification()
  │               → UiState::apply_notification()
  │               → cross-cutting handlers (CommandOptionsReceived, CommandExecuted, etc.)
  ├─ PermissionRequest → UiState::show_approval()
  └─ Terminal Event → layered key dispatch
                                                                    ↓
                                              ratatui render (adaptive frame rate)
```

### Key Boundaries

**Bridge thread (`protocol/bridge.rs`):** Runs `!Send` ACP types in a quarantined `current_thread` + `LocalSet` runtime. All communication is via three bounded mpsc channels: commands in, notifications out, permission requests out. The bridge MUST send a notification for every command it processes — including error cases — so the App never gets stuck.

**Conversion boundary (`protocol/convert/`):** Directory module that imports both `acp::` and internal types. `mod.rs` handles generic ACP; `kiro.rs` handles Kiro-specific extensions. No other file should import `acp::` types.

**TuiState trait (`cyril-ui/traits.rs`):** Read-only interface the renderer uses. Every method returns a reference or Copy type — compile-time guarantee that rendering cannot mutate state. The renderer receives `&dyn TuiState`, never `&App` or `&mut UiState`.

### Notification-Driven Architecture

All agent interactions are notification-driven. Commands return immediately; results arrive as notifications:

| User action | BridgeCommand | Notification back | App reacts |
|---|---|---|---|
| Send prompt | `SendPrompt` | `AgentMessage`, `ToolCallStarted`, `TurnCompleted` | Streams to chat |
| `/new` | `NewSession` | `SessionCreated` | Updates session state |
| `/model` (no args) | `QueryCommandOptions` | `CommandOptionsReceived` | Opens picker |
| `/tools` | `ExecuteCommand` | `CommandExecuted` | Shows formatted response |
| Picker confirms | `ExecuteCommand` | `CommandExecuted` | Shows confirmation |

**The event loop must NEVER block on command execution.** Commands send a `BridgeCommand` and return `Dispatched`. Results come back asynchronously as notifications.

### Subagent Support

Kiro v1.29+ supports subagents — child sessions spawned from the main agent that run in parallel with their own tool access and message streams. Cyril observes, displays, and controls these via:

> **KAS uses a different subagent model.** This whole section describes the **v1/v2** engine (`agent_crew` + `kiro.dev/subagent/list_update`, which `SubagentTracker`/`crew_panel` key off). The **KAS** engine sends **no `list_update`** — its subagents are plain `tool_call`s tagged `_meta.kiro.kind: "agent-subtask"`, grouped by `agentSubtaskId`, with an `OrchestrateSubAgent` DAG tool (one-shot, fail-fast, no loop) and bundled verification agents (`semantic_reviewer`, `functional_task_alignment`). Rendering KAS crews needs a separate path — see ROADMAP KAS-3 and [docs/kiro-2.7.1-wire-audit.md](docs/kiro-2.7.1-wire-audit.md).

**Components:**

- **`SubagentTracker`** (`cyril-core/src/subagent.rs`) — Pure state machine defined in `cyril-core`, held as a field inside `UiState` (cyril-ui). Tracks metadata from `kiro.dev/subagent/list_update` notifications: which subagents are active, their status, group, dependencies, and inbox counters. `apply_notification(&Notification) -> bool`, same pattern as `SessionController`.
- **`SubagentUiState`** (`cyril-ui/src/subagent_ui.rs`) — Per-subagent message streams (`HashMap<SessionId, SubagentStream>`), drill-in focus state, and `any_active()` for frame rate. Each `SubagentStream` mirrors `UiState`'s streaming-text → committed-message pattern.
- **`crew_panel`** widget (`cyril-ui/src/widgets/crew_panel.rs`) — Renders a bordered status bar with one row per subagent + pending stage. Clamps to `MAX_CREW_ROWS` with a `+N more` overflow indicator. Single source of truth for sizing via `height_for(state)`.

**Notification routing via `RoutedNotification`:**

Every session notification carries a `session_id` from the ACP envelope. The bridge → App channel carries `RoutedNotification { session_id: Option<SessionId>, notification: Notification }`. The App compares `session_id` against its main session and routes:

- `None` or matches main → dispatched to `SessionController` + `UiState` (main pipeline)
- Matches a known subagent in the tracker → dispatched to `UiState::apply_subagent_notification` (creates stream on first contact)
- Unknown session → also routes to subagent stream (optimistic, in case `list_update` hasn't arrived yet)

`SubagentListUpdated` is global — it updates both the tracker and `SubagentUiState::apply_list_update` (which marks removed streams terminated, preserving their history).

**Slash commands** (`cyril-core/src/commands/subagent.rs`):

- `/sessions` — lists active subagents and pending stages from the tracker
- `/spawn <name> <task>` — sends `BridgeCommand::SpawnSession`
- `/kill <name>` — looks up by `session_name` via `SubagentTracker::find_by_name()`, sends `BridgeCommand::TerminateSession`
- `/msg <name> <text>` — same lookup, sends `BridgeCommand::SendMessage`

Subagent commands need read access to `SubagentTracker`, so `CommandContext` carries `subagent_tracker: Option<&SubagentTracker>`. Tests that don't exercise subagent commands pass `None`.

**Drill-in:** When a subagent is focused (`focus_subagent()`), `chat::render` swaps the main viewport for the focused subagent's stream with a `─── <name> [Esc] Back` header. `SubagentUiState::focus()` validates that the session has an active stream — returns `false` and logs a warning if not. Esc key exits drill-in before cancelling a busy session.

**Frame rate:** When any subagent stream is actively streaming or running tools, `any_subagent_active()` returns `true` and the adaptive frame rate uses fast tick (50ms).

### Key Handling Layers

Input dispatch follows strict priority (each layer consumes or passes through):

1. **Global shortcuts** (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Q, Ctrl+M) — always active
2. **Approval overlay** — consumes all keys if active, early return
3. **Picker overlay** — consumes all keys if active, early return
4. **Hooks panel overlay** — Esc closes, arrow/page keys scroll, all others consumed
5. **Code panel overlay** — Esc closes, `r` refreshes, all others consumed
6. **Autocomplete** — `handle_autocomplete_key()` returns `AutocompleteAction` enum (Consumed/Accepted/AcceptedAndSubmit/NotActive), early return unless NotActive
7. **Normal input** — Enter submits, Esc cancels, other keys go to textarea

Any new modal overlay must be added to both this chain and the mouse-scroll guard in `handle_terminal_event`.

### Streaming Content Model

Agent text and tool calls commit to the message list in chronological order as they arrive:

- `AgentMessage` chunks accumulate in `streaming_text`
- When `ToolCallStarted` arrives, flush `streaming_text` to a committed `AgentText` message, then commit the tool call to messages at that position
- `ToolCallUpdated` updates the committed tool call in-place via `merge_update` (preserves content/locations from initial notification)
- When `TurnCompleted` arrives, flush any remaining `streaming_text`
- Result: messages list has `[AgentText, ToolCall, AgentText, ...]` in arrival order

### Path Translation (`cyril-core/src/platform/path.rs`)

On Windows, all paths crossing the WSL boundary go through `win_to_wsl()` / `wsl_to_win()`. On Linux, path translation is a no-op.

## ACP Protocol Notes

For the comprehensive protocol reference with example requests/responses, see **[docs/kiro-acp-protocol.md](docs/kiro-acp-protocol.md)**.

> **⚠️ Two engines as of kiro-cli 2.7.1.** Everything in this section describes the **v1/v2 (Rust) engine** — cyril's current default (`kiro-cli acp`). 2.7.1 embeds a **second engine, KAS** (`acp --agent-engine kas` / hidden `chat --v3`), a TypeScript/LangGraph agent with its own **`_kiro/*` dialect** that differs on several points below. KAS is reachable over ACP today and is the strategic direction. Several v2-only claims in this section are **not** true for KAS — they're flagged inline. **Full KAS wire reference: [docs/kiro-2.7.1-wire-audit.md](docs/kiro-2.7.1-wire-audit.md)** (auth contract, subagent/crew model, fs+terminal host callbacks, hooks, bundled agents, steering fileMatch, agent-config migration). **Authoritative `_kiro/*` type contract: [docs/kiro-kas-acp-covenant.md](docs/kiro-kas-acp-covenant.md)** — the curated `@kiro/acp-type-covenant` reference (full method catalog, `KiroClientMeta` handshake flags, `AgentSettings`, `session_info_update` union, host-callback signatures). **For any KAS `_kiro/*` question, read the covenant doc/package FIRST** — it is the wire contract; `@kiro/agent` is only the implementation, and reading it instead produced wrong conclusions. The KAS integration plan is **ROADMAP "KAS engine integration track" (KAS-1…6)**.

- **Protocol**: JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio (ACP v2025-01-01)
- The `agent-client-protocol` crate (v0.10.2; schema `agent-client-protocol-schema` v0.11.2) from crates.io is the source of truth for ACP types. Actual type definitions live in the schema crate (transitive dependency). Note: `SessionUpdate` is a serde-tagged enum with no `#[serde(other)]` catch-all, so an unknown typed `session/update` variant hard-fails at deserialization before reaching `convert/`; the `_kiro.dev/*` / `_kiro/*` ext dialects ride the raw-JSON `ext_notification` path and are not subject to this.
- Tool calls with `kind == ToolKind::Other` are "planning" steps from the agent and are filtered from display.
- **Kiro logs**: `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/kiro-log/kiro-chat.log` (Linux). Set `KIRO_LOG_LEVEL=debug` for verbose output.
- **Wire format = binary × backend.** What kiro-cli emits depends on both the binary version and the AWS backend's current behavior. Same-day captures with different binaries isolate binary changes; same-binary captures across time isolate backend rollouts. Mixing the axes conflates both — the metering fields appearing on `_kiro.dev/metadata` between April and May 2026 was a backend rollout, not a binary change.
- **Wire-format audit artifacts:** [`experiments/conductor-spike/`](experiments/conductor-spike/README.md) has same-day 2.1.0/2.2.0 baselines, the `diff_fields.py` structural differ, and reproducible wrapper scripts. Use these for any wire-format investigation rather than rebuilding from scratch.

### Session Updates (`session/update`)

Sent as `SessionNotification` containing a `SessionUpdate` enum. **Turn completion is signaled by the `session/prompt` response** (with `stop_reason: EndTurn`), not by a notification.

Key variants: `AgentMessageChunk`, `AgentThoughtChunk`, `ToolCall`, `ToolCallUpdate`, `Plan`, `AvailableCommandsUpdate`, `CurrentModeUpdate`, `ConfigOptionUpdate`.

### Tool Call Lifecycle

Tool calls follow a three-phase lifecycle:
1. `ToolCall` with `status: InProgress` — tool initiated
2. `ToolCall` with `status: Pending` — title updated (e.g., "Reading file.rs:1"), awaiting permission if needed
3. `ToolCallUpdate` with `status: Completed` — execution finished

The agent may initiate multiple tool calls in parallel before waiting for permission responses.

### Permission Requests (`session/request_permission`)

A server-to-client request (has an `id`, expects a JSON-RPC response). The agent asks for permission before executing certain tools.

- **File reads** do not require permission — they execute automatically
- **Shell commands** require permission — options are typically `Yes(AllowOnce)`, `Always(AllowAlways)`, `No(RejectOnce)`
- `AllowAlways` makes the agent remember the choice for the rest of the session

### `session/cancel`

A notification (fire-and-forget, no response expected). Cyril sends this on Esc when `is_busy`.

### Kiro Extension Commands (`kiro.dev/commands/*`)

**`commands/execute`** — The `command` field must be an object `{"command": "<name>", "args": {<args>}}` (a `TuiCommand` adjacently tagged enum), NOT a plain string. Sending a string crashes kiro-cli. Selection commands pass their value as `{"value": "<selected>"}` in args.

**`commands/options`** — Query available options for selection commands. Options use `label` (not `name`) for display, plus `value`, `description`, `group`, and optional `current` boolean.

**`commands/available`** — Notification sent after session creation with the full command list, tools, and MCP servers.

**`metadata`** — Notification with `contextUsagePercentage` after each turn. Not in official docs.

### `session/new` Response

Includes more than just `session_id`:
- `modes` — `SessionModeState` with `current_mode_id` and `available_modes` list (displayed in toolbar)
- `config_options` — always `null` on the v1/v2 engine (`session/set_config_option` not implemented). **KAS populates it** (`mode`/`autopilot`/`contentCollection`) and `set_config_option` works there.

### Methods NOT implemented by the v1/v2 engine (KAS differs — see the KAS audit)

These hold for the default v1/v2 (Rust) engine. **KAS implements several of them** — verify against `docs/kiro-2.7.1-wire-audit.md` before assuming a method is unavailable when running `--agent-engine kas`.

- `session/set_config_option` — v1/v2: "Method not found" (use `kiro.dev/commands/execute` with `model`). **KAS: works** (`{sessionId, configId, value}` → rebuilt `configOptions`).
- `session/set_model` — behind unstable feature flag, not advertised in capabilities.
- `session/fork`, `session/resume`, `session/list` — v1/v2: unstable, `sessionCapabilities: {}`. **KAS: `sessionCapabilities {list, fork}` are non-empty and functional.**

## Adding New Features

### New ACP event type
1. Add a variant to the appropriate sub-enum in `event.rs` (`ProtocolEvent` for standard ACP, `ExtensionEvent` for Kiro-specific)
2. Emit it from `KiroClient` in `protocol/client.rs` wrapped in `AppEvent::Protocol(...)` or `AppEvent::Extension(...)`
3. Handle it in the matching `App::handle_*_event()` method in `app.rs`

### New slash command
1. Add the command name to `parse_command()` match in `commands.rs`
2. Implement the handler as an associated function on `CommandExecutor` — take only what you need as parameters
3. Call it from the `execute()` dispatch match

### New session state
1. Add a private field to `SessionContext` in `session.rs` with a getter and setter
2. If the field has a cache invariant (like `cached_model`), maintain it in the setter
3. Update from the appropriate event handler in `app.rs`

### New UI component
1. Create a module in `cyril/src/ui/` with a `State` struct and `render()` function
2. Add the state to `App` in `app.rs`
3. Call the render function from `App::render()`
4. Handle input in `App::handle_key()` (overlay popups take priority — check approval/picker first)

### Channel sends in spawned tasks
Always use `CommandExecutor::send_or_log()` instead of `let _ = sender.send()`. Silent send failures can freeze the UI (e.g., `toolbar.is_busy` stuck true).

## Design Principles

### Make illegal states unrepresentable

Use the type system to prevent bugs at compile time rather than catching them at runtime.

**Use newtypes for domain identifiers.** `SessionId`, `ToolCallId` — never pass raw `String` where a typed ID is expected. Every field that carries a session or tool call identifier must use the newtype, not `String`.

**Use `Option` for absent values, not sentinels.** Never use a concrete enum variant (like `ToolKind::Other`) or a magic value (like `0.0` or `""`) to mean "not specified." If a value may be absent, the type should be `Option<T>`. Sentinel values break `merge_update` patterns — you can't distinguish "explicitly set to X" from "not provided."

**Guard partial updates.** When merging update fields into existing state, only overwrite fields the update actually provides. An update with an empty string for `name` means "name was not provided," not "set name to empty." Use guards like `if update.field.is_some()` or `if !update.field.is_empty()`.

**Errors are not default values.** Never use `unwrap_or(0.0)`, `unwrap_or("")`, or `unwrap_or_default()` to handle parse failures or missing data. These hide real errors as plausible-looking defaults. Instead:
- Return `None` / skip the notification if the data is genuinely optional
- Return `Err` if the data is required
- At minimum, log a warning before falling back

**Bridge errors must notify the App.** Every failed bridge operation (`prompt`, `new_session`, `load_session`, `set_session_mode`) must send a notification back through the channel so the UI can recover. Logging alone is invisible to the user — the UI will get stuck in a transitional state.

**`commit_streaming` flushes text on boundaries.** When a tool call starts, flush accumulated streaming text to a committed message first. This prevents text segments from concatenating across tool call boundaries. Content commits in chronological order — tool calls go into messages at the position where they arrived, not at the end.

### Testing layers

State tests verify data transitions. Render tests verify presentation. Both are needed:

- **State lifecycle tests**: Apply a realistic sequence of notifications (text → tool call → update → turn complete) and verify committed messages contain all content in order.
- **Render order tests**: Render to `TestBackend`, extract the buffer, assert character positions maintain chronological order.
- **Merge tests**: Verify that partial updates preserve existing fields (content, locations, title, raw_input) when the update doesn't provide them.

## Rust Code Standards

### Workspace Safety Rails

These are already configured — maintain them when adding crates or dependencies:

- **Unsafe is forbidden** — `[workspace.lints.rust] unsafe_code = "forbid"` in root `Cargo.toml`
- **Lint inheritance** — every member crate has `[lints] workspace = true`. Never override lints per-crate.
- **Pinned toolchain** — `rust-toolchain.toml` locks the exact Rust version (`1.94.0`), not `"stable"`. `rust-version` in `[workspace.package]` mirrors it for downstream consumers.
- **Minimal toolchain profile** — only `rustfmt` and `clippy` components. Don't add extras unless needed.
- **Centralized versions** — all dependency versions live in `[workspace.dependencies]`. Member crates reference with `{ workspace = true }`, never specifying their own version.
- **Explicit feature selection** — `default-features = false` then list only what you need (see `tokio`, `crossterm`, `pulldown-cmark` in the root `Cargo.toml` for examples).

### Build Profiles

Four profiles are configured — use the right one:

- **`dev`**: `incremental = true`, `opt-level = 0` — fast compile cycles
- **`test`**: `opt-level = 1` — tests run faster without full optimization penalty
- **`release`**: `lto = "fat"`, `codegen-units = 1`, `strip = "symbols"` — smallest, fastest binary
- **`release-with-debug`**: inherits release but keeps `debug = 2`, `strip = "none"` — for production crash investigation

### Code Discipline

These are project invariants maintained from inception, not aspirations. Maintaining them is dramatically easier than retrofitting.

- **Zero `.unwrap()` in non-test code** — enforced by `clippy::unwrap_used = "deny"` at the workspace level. Propagate with `?`, use `if let` / `match`, or return `Option`/`Result`. `.expect("reason")` is allowed (warning-level) for compile-time invariants like hardcoded regex.
- **Zero `let _ =` discarded Results** — handle or propagate every `Result`. If truly best-effort, log the error: `if let Err(e) = operation { warn!(...) }`. Use `send_or_log()` for channel sends.
- **Zero `#[allow(...)]` directives** — don't suppress warnings, fix them. When every warning is resolved, new compiler/clippy lints are immediately actionable signal, not buried in noise.
- **Zero sentinel values** — covered in Design Principles under "Use `Option` for absent values." Restated here: never use magic values (`0.0`, `""`, a catch-all enum variant) to mean "absent."

### Error Type Design

- **Use `thiserror`** — `#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]` for all error types. The workspace already depends on `thiserror`.
- **Map external errors at the boundary** — convert library-specific errors into your domain's error variants in `convert/` or adapter code. Never leak third-party error types (like `acp::` errors) across crate boundaries.
- **Structured error metadata** — error types should carry enough context to diagnose without a debugger (command attempted, response received, what went wrong).
- **Accessor methods over `pub` fields** — expose error data through methods, not public struct fields. This lets you refactor internals without breaking callers.

### Test Organization

- **Unit tests colocated** — `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` in the same file as production code
- **Integration tests in `tests/`** — each `.rs` file compiles as its own crate
- **`tempfile::tempdir()` for isolation** — no hardcoded paths, automatic cleanup. The workspace already depends on `tempfile`.
- **Fixture data as files** — `tests/fixtures/` with expected input/output pairs for complex scenarios
- **Helper functions, not macros** — extract common test setup as plain functions
- **Test error messages explicitly** — verify error wording with `assert_eq!(failure.to_string(), "expected message")` to catch regressions in user-facing errors
- **Snapshot testing with `insta`** — use for complex output comparisons where exact string matching is brittle

### Silent Failure Prevention

- **Log before returning `None`** — if a function returns `Option` and the `None` path represents something going wrong (not just "not found"), log context at `debug!` or `warn!` level before returning.
- **Return `Err` for invalid inputs, not empty collections** — `Ok(Vec::new())` when the input was malformed is misleading; it looks like success.
- **Distinguish "missing" from "corrupt"** — a file that doesn't exist and a file that fails to parse are different failure modes. Don't collapse them with `.ok()?`.
- **Audit `.ok()`, `filter_map(Result::ok)`, `let _ =`** — before using these, ask: "Does anyone need to know which failure mode this was?"

## Platform Constraints

- **Linux:** spawns `kiro-cli acp` directly; requires kiro-cli installed and on PATH
- **Windows:** spawns `wsl kiro-cli acp`; requires WSL with kiro-cli installed and authenticated (`wsl kiro-cli login`)
- Path translation (`C:\` ↔ `/mnt/c/`) is active only on Windows; on Linux it's a no-op
- Terminal commands from the agent run natively on the host OS
- Logs go to `cyril.log` in the working directory (append mode) to avoid TUI conflicts

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in **rivets**, a local Rust JSONL-backed tracker (`rivets` CLI; run `rivets init` first). See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Canonical five-role vocabulary (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`), applied as rivets labels. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
