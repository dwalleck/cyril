{{CUSTOM_INSTRUCTION}}

Create a context window checkpoint for this chat session. This will be picked up by another agent to continue the work. Output a structured document using the sections below. DO NOT respond conversationally.

## OBJECTIVE
The user's primary goal or end state they're working toward.

## USER GUIDANCE
Explicit requirements, preferences, or directions from the user.

## COMPLETED
What has been done so far, including key decisions and their rationale.

## TECHNICAL CONTEXT
Implementation details required to continue correctly: files, symbols, code snippets, patterns, assumptions, constraints, invariants.

## TOOLS EXECUTED
Significant tool calls with their results and side effects.

## NEXT STEPS
Concrete, forward-looking actions that remain.

    "description": "A tool for indexing and searching content across chat sessions using semantic search.\n\n## Overview\nThis tool enables persistent storage and retrieval of information using semantic search (MiniLLM) or keyword search (BM25). Content remains available across sessions for later use.\n\n## When to use\n- When users ask to query your knowledge bases or kbs\n- When you need to search previously indexed content\n- When users request to index new content (code, markdown, CSV, PDF, and other text file formats)\n- When exploring unfamiliar content to find relevant information\n- When users ask about topics that might be in indexed knowledge bases\n\n## When not to use\n- When content has not been indexed yet and user hasn't requested indexing\n- When you need real-time or external information not in the knowledge base\n\n## Notes\n- Use 'show' command to list available knowledge bases before searching\n- Search can target specific knowledge bases (context_id) or all knowledge bases\n- Use default limit values unless specifically needed; fewer results for focused search\n- Pagination available via offset parameter for large result sets\n- 'add' command indexes new content; 'update' command refreshes existing knowledge bases\n- Unless there is a clear reason to modify the search query, use the user's original wording for better semantic matching",

Only use 'delegate' if the user explicitly requests background/async execution or mentions 'delegate' by name.\n\nLaunch and manage asynchronous agent processes. This tool allows you to delegate tasks to agents that run independently in the background.\n\nOperations:\n- launch: Start a new task with an agent (requires task parameter, agent is optional)\n- status: Check agent status and get full output if completed. Agent is optional - defaults to 'all' if not specified\n\nIf no agent is specified for launch, uses 'default_agent'. Only one task can run per agent at a time. Files are stored in .kiro/.subagents/\n\nIMPORTANT: If a specific agent is requested but not found, DO NOT automatically retry with 'default_agent' or any other agent. Simply report the error and available agents to the user.\n\nExample usage:\n1. Launch with agent: {\"operation\": \"launch\", \"agent\": \"rust-agent\", \"task\": \"Create a snake game\"}\n2. Launch without agent: {\"operation\": \"launch\", \"task\": \"Write a Python script\"}\n3. Check specific agent: {\"operation\": \"status\", \"agent\": \"rust-agent\"}\n4.

The system automatically resolves @prompt references before the subagent starts â the prompt content is expanded inline and the subagent receives the fully resolved text. Do NOT refuse to delegate because a query contains `@prompt-name` syntax.\n\nExample: `{\"query\": \"@my-task 'arg1:value1, arg2:value2'\"}` â this is valid and will be resolved.\n\n## How Subagents Are Different:\n- Subagents have DIFFERENT, SPECIALIZED toolsets than you\n- Each subagent may have tools you don't have access to\n- They operate independently with their own context\n- Up to 4 subagents can work in parallel\n\n## Decision Flow:\n```\nUser makes request â Check YOUR tools list â Missing required tool? â USE use_subagent\n                                          â Have required tool? â Handle it yourself\n```\n\nâ¡ Remember: Don't apologize about lacking tools - just delegate to a subagent that has them! Also note that subagents that are spawned together could not communicate with each other. If they are to perform tasks that are dependent on each other. Spawn them with a different tool call!",

For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.\n\n## Handling Ambiguity in Plans\nBefore using this tool, ensure your plan is clear and unambiguous. If there are multiple valid approaches or unclear requirements:\n1. Ask the user questions to clarify\n2. Ask about specific implementation choices (e.g., architectural patterns, which library to use)\n3. Clarify any assumptions that could affect the implementation\n4. Edit your plan to incorporate user feedback\n5. Only proceed with SwitchToExecution after resolving ambiguities",

CRITICAL: You MUST use introspect tool FIRST to verify setting names and understand their purpose before using set operation.\n\n## Session vs Persistent Settings\n- **session tool**: Temporary in-memory changes (cleared when chat exits) - Use for quick experiments or one-time adjustments\n- **fs_write tool**: Permanent changes saved to disk - Use when user says \"save\", \"persist\", \"permanently\", or \"always\"\n  - Global settings: ~/.kiro/settings.json\n  - Workspace settings: .kiro/settings.json\n\n## When to Use Each Tool\n- User: \"disable markdown\" â session tool (temporary)\n- User: \"disable markdown permanently\" â fs_write to ~/.kiro/settings.json (global) or .kiro/settings.json (workspace)\n- User: \"save this setting\" â fs_write (persistent)\n- User: \"try disabling markdown\" â session tool (temporary)\n\n## REQUIRED Workflow for Setting Changes\n1. User asks to change a setting\n2. Use introspect tool to find the correct setting name and understand what it does\n3. Determine if temporary (session) or permanent (fs_write)\n4. Use appropriate tool\n\n## Operations\n- **list**: Show currently configured session settings (non-default values only)\n- **get**: Get the current value of a specific setting\n- **set**: Change a setting value temporarily (MUST verify setting name with introspect first)\n- **reset**: Clear session override for a specific setting, or all session overrides if no key provided\n\n## Example Workflows\nTemporary change:\n  User: \"disable markdown\"\n  1. introspect(query=\"markdown setting\") â learn about chat.disableMarkdownRendering\n  2. session(operation=\"set\", key=\"chat.disableMarkdownRendering\", value=true)\n\nReset single setting:\n  User: \"reset markdown setting\"\n  session(operation=\"reset\", key=\"chat.disableMarkdownRendering\")\n\nReset all session overrides:\n  User: \"clear all my temporary settings\"\n  session(operation=\"reset\")\n\nPermanent change:\n  User: \"disable markdown permanently\"\n  1. introspect(query=\"markdown setting\") â learn about chat.disableMarkdownRendering\n  2. fs_write to modify ~/.kiro/settings.json with {\"chat.disableMarkdownRendering\": true}\n\nDO NOT guess setting names - always verify with introspect first.",
