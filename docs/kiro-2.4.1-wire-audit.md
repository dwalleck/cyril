# Kiro CLI 2.4.1 — ACP Wire Audit

> **Captured 2026-05-21** using `experiments/conductor-spike/` against today's backend. Binary-isolated test: same backend, two binaries (2.3.0 archived vs 2.4.1 freshly installed). Methodology details in [`docs/kiro-acp-protocol.md`](kiro-acp-protocol.md) and the `wire-audit-methodology` reference in user auto-memory.

**Released**: 2026-05-21 (S3 tarball; manifest version bumped 2.3.0 → 2.4.1, with 2.4.0 also published on S3). Build hash `937fa9a6ff55382dd599408c80bb4b87517146ad` dated 2026-05-21.

## Audit setup

Binary-isolated, same-backend test:

- **Reference**: 2.3.0 (archived at `~/.local/share/kiro-research/binaries/2.3.0/`) — `kiro-cli-chat` sha256 `96ba63cb…`
- **Capture**: 2.4.1 (archived at `~/.local/share/kiro-research/binaries/2.4.1/`) — `kiro-cli-chat` sha256 `8d125143…`
- **Tarball**: `https://desktop-release.q.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2.4.1/kirocli-x86_64-linux.tar.zst` (sha256 `91f41aff…`)
- **Wrappers**: `experiments/conductor-spike/conductor-wrapper-2.3.0.sh`, `conductor-wrapper-2.4.1.sh`
- **Harness output**: `experiments/conductor-spike/test_bridge-2.3.0.out`, `test_bridge-2.4.1.out`
- **Harness change**: added steps `9b` (`/stats` post-prompt) and `9c` (`/effort` options) to `crates/cyril/examples/test_bridge.rs` to exercise the two release-targeted areas. Existing steps unchanged; comparisons against pre-2.3.0 captures still hold for the original 10-step scenario.

## Exercised-wire result

Across the 14 ACP methods exercised by both runs, **one structural field delta**:

```
[_kiro.dev/commands/options (response)]
  + result.options
```

Reason: 2.4.1 returns a well-formed `commands/options` response for `command: "effort"` with `options: []`. 2.3.0 forwards the request to its kiro-cli-chat backend and the backend **silently never responds** — id 11 stays open and the next request never goes on the wire. The differ records this as "response present in 2.4.1, absent in 2.3.0," which is correct framing.

```
[_kiro.dev/commands/available (request/notif)] — no field deltas (17 fields)
[_kiro.dev/commands/execute (request/notif)] — no field deltas (4 fields)
[_kiro.dev/commands/execute (response)] — no field deltas (57 fields)
[_kiro.dev/commands/options (request/notif)] — no field deltas (3 fields)
[_kiro.dev/commands/options (response)] — + result.options
[_kiro.dev/metadata (request/notif)] — no field deltas (6 fields)
[_kiro.dev/subagent/list_update (request/notif)] — no field deltas (2 fields)
[initialize (request/notif)] — no field deltas (7 fields)
[initialize (response)] — no field deltas (12 fields)
[session/new (request/notif)] — no field deltas (2 fields)
[session/new (response)] — no field deltas (9 fields)
[session/prompt (request/notif)] — no field deltas (3 fields)
[session/prompt (response)] — no field deltas (1 fields)
[session/update (request/notif)] — no field deltas (4 fields)
```

Notable non-result: **`commands/execute (response)` jumped from 44 to 57 fields between 2.2.2/2.3.0 and 2.3.0/2.4.1.** That's not a binary change between 2.3.0 and 2.4.1 — both captures today report 57. Same-day backend behavior; the 44→57 happened sometime between the 2.3.0 audit (May 11) and today. Treat as a backend rollout, not a binary change.

## Slash-command additions

**Two new commands** in the `commands/available` notification — 21 → 23 in 2.4.1:

```
+ /effort   "Set thinking effort for this session"
            inputType: "selection", searchable: false
+ /rewind   "Rewind conversation to a previous turn (forks into a new session)"
            inputType: "panel"
```

### `/effort`

- **Slot in `commands/available`**: present in 2.4.1, absent in 2.3.0.
- **`commands/options { command: "effort" }` response in 2.4.1**: `{ options: [], hasMore: false }`. Empty today — backend hasn't lit up effort values for the auto/Claude model in use. Schema is wired and parseable; values are gated.
- **Same request to 2.3.0**: backend hangs without responding (no `result`, no `error`). Subsequent client requests are blocked behind the in-flight id, breaking the session for the remainder of the run.
- **New wire-field strings in `kiro-cli-chat` 2.4.1**: `"effort"`, `"effort_update"`. Both absent in 2.3.0 (0 matches).
- **New Rust type**: `agent::agent::tui_commands::command::EffortArgs`, confirmed via mangled-symbol presence in 2.4.1 (`_ZN…tui_commands..command..EffortArgs..deserialize..`). Absent in 2.3.0 (0 matches for `EffortArgs` or `tui_commands..command..Effort`). Thinking-effort is net-new in the 2.4.x series — there is no 2.3.0 scaffolding precedent.

### `/rewind`

- **`inputType: "panel"`** is a richer input mode than any prior command (selection/text-only). Suggests a multi-step UI flow (pick a turn, confirm fork).
- **New Rust module**: `crates/chat-cli-v2/src/agent/acp/commands/rewind.rs` (3 matches for `agent..acp..commands..rewind` mangled-symbol path in 2.4.1, 0 in 2.3.0).
- **New Rust types**: `RewindArgs` (4 matches in 2.4.1, 0 in 2.3.0). `/rewind` is net-new in 2.4.x — no Rust scaffolding in 2.3.0.
- Not exercised by this run's `commands/execute` — fork semantics aren't a same-session operation.

## `/stats` token counts — backend gate still closed

Sent `/stats` after the "Say hello in one word" turn on both binaries, same backend. Both responses identical in schema and in null-ness:

```json
{
  "stats": [{
    "duration_ms": 1273.84,        // populated (client-side measurement)
    "ttfc_ms":     1069.50,        // populated (client-side measurement)
    "input_tokens":  null,         // null on BOTH 2.3.0 and 2.4.1
    "output_tokens": null,         // null on BOTH 2.3.0 and 2.4.1
    "had_tool_use": false,
    "error": null,
    "request_id": "...",
    "status_code": null,
    "timestamp": "..."
  }],
  "summary": { "avg_ms": ..., "p90_ms": ..., "max_ms": ..., "errors": 0 }
}
```

**Conclusion**: token-count population is a backend-rollout question, not a binary question. Same-day same-backend isolation: if the binary were the variable, 2.4.1 would diverge; it doesn't. The `input_tokens`/`output_tokens` schema is present in both binaries (2.3.0's was the first to advertise it, per the `reference_kiro_2_3_0_diff.md` memory). Whether the backend will eventually populate these is observable via repeated capture against the same binary over time.

`_kiro.dev/metadata` continues to emit `meteringUsage` (credits) and `turnDurationMs` but no per-turn token totals.

## KAS backend — assets still NOT embedded

Static binary analysis says KAS assets did not land in 2.4.1:

- **`kiro-cli-chat` size delta**: +2.36 MB (395.18 → 397.54). The KAS bundle as it ships in Kiro IDE is ~36 MB (see `reference_kiro_ide_agent_extension.md`). +2 MB is far too small to contain it.
- **`"KAS assets not embedded and KIRO_KAS_SERVER_PATH not set"`** string still present in 2.4.1 (same as 2.3.0).
- Extraction-side code matured: new tracing event fields `node_extracted`, `kas_extracted`, `asset_sha_path`, `asset_path`, `time_elapsed_ms` in `crates/chat-cli/src/embedded_tui.rs`. The plumbing is wired and waiting for assets.
- KAS namespace (`_kiro/*` per IDE evidence) never appears on the wire — the 2.4.1 binary still emits only `_kiro.dev/*`.

State: same as 2.3.0 — the engine flag (`--agent-engine kas`), env vars (`KIRO_AGENT_ENGINE`, `KIRO_KAS_SERVER_PATH`), and extraction code exist; assets are externally supplied via `KIRO_KAS_SERVER_PATH` only.

## Binary delta

| Binary          | 2.3.0 size  | 2.4.1 size  | Δ        |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| `kiro-cli`      | 117.86 MB   | 118.24 MB   | +0.37 MB |
| `kiro-cli-chat` | 395.18 MB   | 397.54 MB   | +2.36 MB |
| `kiro-cli-term` | 85.89 MB    | 86.06 MB    | +0.16 MB |

Two new files in the tarball that weren't in 2.3.0:

- `bin/q` (65 bytes) — `sh -c 'kiro-cli --show-legacy-warning "$@"'`
- `bin/qchat` (70 bytes) — `sh -c 'kiro-cli --show-legacy-warning chat "$@"'`

Backward-compat shims for Amazon Q legacy users. The new `--show-legacy-warning` flag confirms a UX path that prints a deprecation notice when users invoke the q-named entry points.

## Rust-module deltas

`crates/(chat-cli|chat-cli-v2|agent)/src/*.rs` source paths embedded in `kiro-cli-chat`:

**New in 2.4.1:**

- `crates/chat-cli/src/launch.rs` — entry-point reorg
- `crates/chat-cli-v2/src/agent/acp/commands/rewind.rs` — `/rewind` handler
- `crates/chat-cli-v2/src/cli/chat/legacy/additional_fields.rs` — chat-cli-v2 legacy compat

**Removed from 2.4.1:**

- `crates/chat-cli/src/api_client/internal_redirect_interceptor.rs`
- `crates/chat-cli-v2/src/api_client/internal_redirect_interceptor.rs`

The redirect-interceptor removal in both crates suggests AWS simplified backend routing — likely no longer transparently following internal redirects. Not visible on the ACP wire.

## Cyril impact

- **`/effort` and `/rewind` slash commands**: cyril surfaces `commands/available` to the UI today. The picker should already render `/effort` once it appears in `commands/available`. `/rewind`'s `inputType: "panel"` is a new input mode — cyril likely defaults to text input or `inputType: "selection"` handling and may need to special-case panel-mode commands.
- **`/effort` options-list semantics**: today returns `options: []`. Cyril's picker should handle "command listed but no values yet" gracefully (avoid empty-picker confusion). Worth testing.
- **Avoid sending `/effort` against pre-2.4.0 binaries**: 2.3.0's silent-hang behavior breaks the session for the rest of the run. Cyril should gate `/effort` usage on `commands/available` presence (which it presumably does — but worth verifying).
- **Token-count rendering**: cyril's `/stats` handling should already treat `input_tokens`/`output_tokens` as nullable. When the backend starts populating them, the UI will start showing real numbers without binary upgrade.
- **No client info / capability changes** — no migration needed.

## Status quo for `effort` and `tokens`

This audit answered both targeted questions:

1. **Is thinking effort exposed in ACP?** Yes, as of 2.4.1 — `/effort` is a real `commands/available` entry with `"effort"`/`"effort_update"` wire fields in the binary. Options-list is empty today (backend-gated, model-dependent).
2. **Does `/stats` carry token counts in newer releases?** Schema yes (since 2.3.0). Values still null on the wire as of today's backend. Same-day same-backend isolation rules out 2.4.1 as the variable.

Next observable change is most likely a backend rollout (token values flipping non-null) rather than a binary upgrade.

## Methodology note

Word-boundary string grep against `kiro-cli-chat` produces a lot of false positives because the binary embeds the entire `tui.js` JavaScript bundle plus V8, SQLite, Bun, and other vendored runtimes. Naive `\bEffort\b` matches things like V8's `Profiler.getBestEffortCoverage`, the regex library's `bestEffortTarget: "ES2025"`, SQLite's `Rewind` opcode, and Squirrel scripting `ctrlAutoScrollRewind` — none of which have anything to do with Kiro's slash-command system. To confirm a Rust-side feature is actually present, filter to mangled-symbol paths (e.g., `tui_commands..command..EffortArgs`, `agent..acp..commands..rewind`) or to fully qualified module paths under `chat_cli`/`chat_cli_v2`/`agent`. The findings above were re-verified against mangled symbols after the initial word-boundary grep produced false matches in 2.3.0 that suggested an effort/rewind scaffolding pattern that does not exist.
